# V.Postscript
|**Safety manual**|
|----------|
|**I.If you listen both, you will be enlightened; if you believe only, you will be dark.**|
|**II.May God bless the pursuer and the pursued. ——《Walter defends Sarajevo》**|
|**III.Believe that you will be free, but also be prepared to face the worst case scenario.**|
|**IV.Where there is trust, there will be betrayal. ——《Call of Duty 6 Modern Warfare 2》**|
|**V.If you want to know the true side of a person, give him strength.**|
|**VI.May we meet again in the spring without walls, and may people outside the walls find their own happiness and joy.**|
|**VII.May you be treated gently by this world, even if life always bullies you with harshness and desolation.**|
|**VIII.May everyone who sees this project be safe and happy.**|
|**IX.May we meet again outside the wall without fear. This day will eventually come.**|
|**X.A cup of tea will slowly cool down, and an ice cube will gradually melt into water. But they cannot go the other way. Water will not gather itself into a piece of ice, because melting is a manifestation of entropy increase. This also reflects the iron law of the continuous expansion of the universe. From order to disorder, the regular process of this system is irreversible, and the entropy value will only increase but not decrease. ——"The Invasion of Doomsday Awakening"**|
|**XI.Being a human being with your tail between your legs is better than being dead. As long as you are still alive, it is not afraid that you will run out of firewood. ——Yuan Tengfei**|
|**XII.After darkness, there must be dawn.**|
|**XIII.In front of us is a strange continent, and behind us is the human fire. At this moment, mankind is moving forward, and peace is the cornerstone for the continuation of the human fire. ——"The Invasion of Doomsday Awakening"**|
|**XIV.If you want to defeat the devil, you must first get close to it, then understand it, and finally defeat it. ——"Tracing the Origin of Apocalyptic Awakening"**|
|**XV.Without indifference, there is no clear ambition; without tranquility, there is no far-reaching goal.**|
|**XVI.Stare into the abyss for too long, and the abyss will stare back. ——Nietzsche, "Beyond Good and Evil"**|
|**XVII.Stay awake in the midst of power! ——Ye Jingzhong**|
|**XVIII.What gets in the way of your destiny are precisely the variables you don't understand, the variables that guide your innermost desires. Under the body, there should not only be flesh and blood, but also the most primitive impulse. ——"The Invasion of Doomsday Awakening"**|
|**XIX.The creators of chaos will be swallowed up by greater chaos. ——"The Invasion of Doomsday Awakening"**|
|**XX.It turns out that the greatest meaning in life is what you once had and the power it gave you. Each of us is a speck of dust in this world, and the dust gathers to create this world. The future is full of hope, and it should not be determined by a certain destiny. It must be fought for by yourself and more partners. Maybe there will be greater difficulties waiting for us, it doesn't matter. We have gained the strength, love, and courage to fight for everything. ——"Tracing the Origin of Apocalyptic Awakening"**|
|**XXI.What you have experienced is the greatest wealth in life. Everything in your memory will inspire you to move forward. Your future is worth looking forward to! ——"Tracing the Origin of Apocalyptic Awakening"**|
|**XXII.No one has ever claimed that this is a country of freedom, because freedom is the product of a society ruled by law and a human rights system. Religion, on the other hand, always distorts and amplifies people's hopes based on what others say, and then turns them into metaphysical fallacies. The shackles of the spirit firmly trap the desires of every person in the shell. They cannot choose. What they face is a life that has never really come alive. There are always people who want to be on par with God. For the impact on future generations, you must graft His faith onto you, even if it is twisted, but this is correct. ——"The Invasion of Doomsday Awakening"**|
|**XXIII.Too often people are too obsessed with themselves. Although we cannot directly observe the thoughts of others visually, we can observe the various materialized forms of human thoughts from the side. ——"The Invasion of Doomsday Awakening"**|
|**XXIV.People always have to make choices. No matter what you choose, there is a 50% chance of regretting it. ——"The Invasion of Doomsday Awakening"**|
|**XXV.You can't trust a system without checks and balances. ——"Tom Clancy's The Division 2"**|
|**XXVI.The purpose of survival should be to erase those imaginary variables and see the reality clearly. The meat on the leg of lamb is much more delicious than the grass roots in the soil. ——"The Invasion of Doomsday Awakening"**|
|**XXVII.It's easy to kill a good man, Colonel, but not so easy to kill a sinner. ——"Zorro (France 1975)"**|
|**XXVIII.As the king of a country, you either have to give up power and enjoy security, or you have to hold power and live in danger. You have to be safe and have power at the same time. There are not so many things that have the best of both worlds in this world, right? ——Yuan Tengfei**|
|**XXIX.If you determine a certain outcome in the future, then fate is determined and there is no chance. As for fate, it should be a variable. ——"Tracing the Origin of Apocalyptic Awakening"**|
|**XXX.Robbers will use any means to achieve their goals.——"Zorro (France 1975)"**|
|**XXXI.Never forget the past, we must have peace and justice in this land. On this day, Zorro will come back.——"Zorro (France 1975)"**|
|**XXXII.What a person says must be true, but there is no obligation to tell all the truth. If you feel that a certain truth will be detrimental to you if you tell it later, you don’t have to say it, you can remain silent, you can keep it in your stomach, but you will never tell a lie, and in the end what you say will still be The truth. ——Kant**|
